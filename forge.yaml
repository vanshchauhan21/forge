      Handling Errors:

      - Use `anyhow::Result` for error handling in services and repositories.
      - Create domain errors using `thiserror`.
      - Never implement `From` for converting domain errors, manually convert them

      Writing Tests:

      - All tests should be written in three discrete steps:

        ```rust
        use pretty_assertions::assert_eq; // Always use pretty assertions

        fn test_foo() {
            let fixture = ...; // Instantiate a fixture for the test
            let actual = ...; // Use the fixture to write a test
            let expected = ...; // Define a hand written expected result
            assert_eq!(actual, expected); // Assert that the actual result matches the expected result
        }
        ```

      - Use `pretty_assertions` for better error messages.
      - Use fixtures to create test data.
      - Use `assert_eq!` for equality checks.
      - Use `assert!(...)` for boolean checks.
      - Use unwraps in test functions and anyhow::Result in fixtures.
      - Keep the boilerplate to a minimum.
      - Use words like `fixture`, `actual` and `expected` in test functions.
      - Fixtures should be generic and reusable.
      - Test should always be written in the same file as the source code.

      Running Tests:
      - We use `insta` to run tests:
      ```
      cargo insta test --accept --unreferenced=delete       
      ```
      
      Verification:
      - run the following command to format and validate if the code is working:
        ```
        cargo +nightly fmt --all; cargo +nightly clippy --fix --allow-staged --allow-dirty --workspace;
        ```
      
      Writing Domain Types:
      - Use `derive_setters` to derive setters and use the `strip_option` and the `into` attributes on the struct types.

      Refactoring:
      - If asked to fix failing tests, always confirm whether to update the implementation or the tests.
