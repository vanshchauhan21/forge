# ⚒️ Forge: AI-Enhanced Terminal Development Environment

![Code-Forge Demo](https://assets.antinomy.ai/images/forge_demo_2x.gif)

Forge is a comprehensive coding agent that integrates AI capabilities with your development environment, offering sophisticated assistance while maintaining the efficiency of your existing workflow. ✨

## 🚀 Installation

Install Forge globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @antinomyhq/forge
```

Or run directly without installation using npx:

```bash
npx @antinomyhq/forge
```

This method works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**, providing a consistent installation experience across all platforms.

## 🔌 Provider Configuration

Forge requires two configuration files in your project directory:

1. A `.env` file with your API credentials
2. A `forge.yaml` file specifying additional settings

Below are setup instructions for each supported provider:

### OpenRouter (Recommended)

```bash
# .env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your_openrouter_api_key>
```

_No changes in `forge.yaml` is required_

### OpenAI

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: o3-mini-high
```

### Anthropic

```bash
# .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_anthropic_api_key>
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: claude-3.7-sonnet
```

### Google Vertex AI

```bash
# .env
PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
LOCATION=<your_location>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<vertex_ai_key>
OPENAI_URL=https://${LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/endpoints/openapi
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-7-sonnet
```

### OpenAI-Compatible Providers

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_provider_api_key>
OPENAI_URL=<your_provider_url>
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: <provider-specific-model>
```

### Amazon Bedrock

To use Amazon Bedrock models with Forge, you'll need to first set up the [Bedrock Access Gateway](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-access-gateway):

1. **Set up Bedrock Access Gateway**:

   - Follow the deployment steps in the [Bedrock Access Gateway repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-access-gateway)
   - Create your own API key in Secrets Manager
   - Deploy the CloudFormation stack
   - Note your API Base URL from the CloudFormation outputs

2. **Create these files in your project directory**:

   ```bash
   # .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_bedrock_gateway_api_key>
   OPENAI_URL=<your_bedrock_gateway_base_url>
   ```

   ```yaml
   # forge.yaml
   model: anthropic.claude-3-opus
   ```

### Advanced Configuration Options

#### `custom_rules`

Add your own guidelines that all agents should follow when generating responses.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
custom_rules: |
  1. Always add comprehensive error handling to any code you write.
  2. Include unit tests for all new functions.
  3. Follow our team's naming convention: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes.
```

The `forge.yaml` file supports several advanced configuration options that let you customize Forge's behavior. Here's a comprehensive list of available fields:

#### `commands`

Define custom commands that as shortcuts for repetitive prompts:

```yaml
# forge.yaml
commands:
  - name: "refactor"
    description: "Refactor selected code"
    prompt: "Please refactor this code to improve readability and performance"
```

#### `model`

Specify the default AI model to use for all agents in the workflow.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: "claude-3.7-sonnet"
```

#### `max_walker_depth`

Control how deeply Forge traverses your project directory structure when gathering context.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
max_walker_depth: 3 # Limit directory traversal to 3 levels deep
```

#### `temperature`

Adjust the creativity and randomness in AI responses. Lower values (0.0-0.3) produce more focused, deterministic outputs, while higher values (0.7-2.0) generate more diverse and creative results.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
temperature: 0.7 # Balanced creativity and focus
```
